## Specifications

You are going to build your very own SaaS (Software as a service) website. New companies always need someone to build their website and here is your chance to do just that. This will be a major portfolio piece for you.

- **Please watch the video below for full requirements.**

  - **üì£  Getting Started:**
    - Watch the video below
    - Make sure to download the project assets and mockup from the previous lesson
    - Download ‚¨áÔ∏è: saas-project-assets.zip (includes images, icons and mockups)

  - **üõ†  Requirements:**
    - Build the website exactly as depicted in the video
    - Each section of the website must look near identical as depicted in the video and mockup below.
    - Cards in "Key benefits" section must have hover effect
    - Must support mobile (375px), iPad/tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px+)
    - No duplicate styles (two different classes should not share the same exact styles. A single class should be used.)
    - HTML must follow a consistent indentation pattern. (HTML style guide)
    - CSS must follow a consistent indentation pattern.
    - No large gaps/empty space between elements.
    - No large gaps/empty space between css style rules.

  - **üèÜ  Extra Credit**
    - Add animations to the site (as depicted in the video)

  - **üí° Tips:**
    - Use flexbox and/or grid to handle the layout (flex-wrap or grid column auto-fit). If leveraged correctly, you won't need to adjust any layout changes in your media queries.
    - If you're creating multiple classes that are grouped and share the same css rule, make a single class instead and apply it to those elements. Large groups of css classes that share the same style rule are harder to manage vs a single class.
